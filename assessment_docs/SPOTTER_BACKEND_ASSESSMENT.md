# Spotter Backend Django Assessment — Fuel Route Optimizer

## 1. Assessment Summary

Build a backend API that accepts:

- Start location in the USA
- Finish location in the USA

The API must:

1. Calculate a drivable route between the two locations.
2. Return route/map geometry that can be displayed on a map.
3. Select cost-effective fuel stations along the route.
4. Respect the vehicle's maximum range of **500 miles**.
5. Allow multiple fuel stops when the trip is longer than 500 miles.
6. Assume fuel efficiency of **10 miles per gallon**.
7. Calculate total fuel cost.
8. Use the supplied fuel-price CSV as the source of fuel prices.
9. Minimize calls to the external routing API; ideally one route request per API request.
10. Be implemented using the latest stable Django release available when the project is built.
11. Include automated tests and clear documentation.
12. Be easy to demonstrate from Postman.

### Supplied data

The provided CSV contains **8,151 fuel-station rows** and these columns:

- `OPIS Truckstop ID`
- `Truckstop Name`
- `Address`
- `City`
- `State`
- `Rack ID`
- `Retail Price`

There are approximately **4,275 unique City + State combinations**.

---

# 2. Recommended Technical Approach

## Backend

- Python 3.12+
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- SQLite for local development
- PostgreSQL-compatible design where practical
- `requests` or `httpx` for external HTTP calls
- `pytest` + `pytest-django` for tests

## Routing / map provider

Use **OSRM** for driving directions.

OSRM can return route geometry as GeoJSON and provides route distance/duration. The application should make **one routing request** for the normal API request.

Example concept:

```text
GET /route/v1/driving/{start_lon},{start_lat};{finish_lon},{finish_lat}?overview=full&geometries=geojson
```

The routing provider should be isolated behind a service class such as:

```text
RoutingService
```

so that another provider can be substituted later.

## Geocoding

Do not geocode all fuel stations during every API request.

Instead, create a preprocessing/management command that geocodes the supplied station dataset and stores the resulting coordinates locally.

A suitable free preprocessing option is the US Census Geocoder batch API. It supports batch address geocoding with up to 10,000 records per batch.

The resulting coordinates should be stored locally in the application's database or in a generated data file.

This keeps the runtime API fast and avoids thousands of external requests.

---

# 3. Important Optimization Decision

The core challenge is not simply:

> Find the cheapest gas station.

It is:

> Find a sequence of affordable fuel stations along the selected route such that no driving segment exceeds the vehicle's 500-mile range, while minimizing total fuel cost.

The algorithm should therefore consider:

- Route position
- Distance from the previous stop
- Distance to the destination
- Fuel price
- Maximum range = 500 miles
- Fuel efficiency = 10 MPG

A practical implementation can model candidate stations as ordered points along the route.

For every candidate station, calculate:

```text
distance_from_route_start
```

Then discard stations that are too far from the route corridor.

A route corridor tolerance such as 25–40 miles can be configurable.

---

# 4. Recommended Fuel-Stop Algorithm

Use a dynamic-programming / shortest-path style optimization over candidate fuel stations.

### State

For each candidate station:

```text
station_id
route_distance_miles
price_per_gallon
```

Add the start and destination as special nodes.

### Feasibility

Two consecutive nodes can be connected only when:

```text
distance_between_nodes <= 500 miles
```

### Cost

The vehicle consumes:

```text
gallons = distance / 10
```

Fuel cost for a segment is:

```text
gallons * price_at_previous_fuel_stop
```

For a realistic strategy, model fuel purchases explicitly rather than blindly charging each segment at the next station's price.

A simpler and explainable assessment implementation is:

- Start with a full tank.
- At every selected fuel stop, purchase enough fuel to reach the next selected stop/destination.
- If a cheaper reachable station exists ahead, prefer carrying enough fuel to reach it.
- If the current station is cheaper than all reachable stations, fill the tank as much as possible.

This is the classic gas-station greedy strategy and can be implemented efficiently after route-position filtering.

The code should document the exact assumptions.

---

# 5. Important Edge Cases

The API must handle:

### Invalid locations

Return HTTP 400:

```json
{
  "error": "Unable to geocode start or finish location."
}
```

### Locations outside the USA

Reject the request with HTTP 400.

### No route

Return an appropriate error rather than crashing.

### Route longer than 500 miles

Return multiple fuel stops.

### No fuel station within range

Return a clear failure:

```json
{
  "error": "No feasible fuel-stop plan exists for this route within the 500 mile vehicle range."
}
```

### Start-to-finish distance <= 500 miles

It may be possible to return zero fuel stops if the assumed vehicle starts with a full tank.

Document this assumption clearly.

### Very long route

Do not assume that every station in the CSV is a candidate.

First reduce the candidate set using route proximity and route order.

# 6. Suggested API

## Endpoint

```http
POST /api/v1/route/fuel-plan/
```

## Request

```json
{
  "start": "New York, NY",

    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY"
  },
  "finish": {
    "city": "Chicago",
    "state": "IL"

    "geometry": {
      "type": "LineString",
      "coordinates": []
    }
  },
  "vehicle": {
    "max_range_miles": 500,
    "miles_per_gallon": 10
  },
  "fuel_stops": [
    {
      "sequence": 1,
      "station_id": 123,
      "name": "Example Truck Stop",
      "address": "Example address",
      "city": "Example City",

    "total_distance_miles": 790.4,
    "total_gallons_consumed": 79.04,
    "total_fuel_cost": 250.00
  }
}
```

The exact cost numbers above are illustrative only.

---

# 7. Database Design

A simple model is enough.

## FuelStation

```text
id
opis_id
name
address
city
state
rack_id
retail_price
latitude
longitude
created_at
updated_at
```

Create indexes on:

```text
state
city
retail_price
latitude
longitude
```

Do not require PostGIS for the assessment unless it materially simplifies the implementation.

# 9. Environment Variables

Create:

```text
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=change-me
DEBUG=True

ROUTING_PROVIDER=osrm

OSRM_BASE_URL=https://router.project-osrm.org

GEOCODER_BASE_URL=https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder
```

If the selected routing/geocoding provider requires an API key, keep it in `.env` and never commit it.

---

# 10. Local Setup

## Windows

Create virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
```

Activate:

```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy environment file:

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
```

Run migrations:

```powershell
python manage.py migrate
```

Import the fuel data:

```powershell
python manage.py import_fuel_prices data/fuel-prices-for-be-assessment.csv
```

If station coordinates have not already been prepared:

```powershell
python manage.py geocode_fuel_stations
```

Run server:

```powershell
python manage.py runserver
```

API:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/route/fuel-plan/
```

---

# 11. Testing with Postman

Method:

```text
POST
```

URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/route/fuel-plan/
```

Headers:

```text
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

```json
{
  "start": "New York, NY",
  "finish": "Chicago, IL"
}
```

Expected response:

- Route distance
- Route duration
- GeoJSON route
- Fuel stops
- Station prices
- Gallons purchased
- Cost per stop
- Total gallons
- Total fuel cost

---

# 12. Performance Strategy

The assessment explicitly asks for fast responses and minimal routing API calls.

Use these principles:

### 1. One routing API call

Do not call the routing API separately for every fuel station.

Call it once:

```text
origin -> destination
```

Use the returned route geometry locally.

### 2. Pre-geocode station data

Do not geocode 8,151 stations during an API request.

Run geocoding as a preprocessing command.

### 3. Filter stations locally

Use:

```text
state
bounding box
route corridor
route position
```

to reduce 8,151 stations to a small candidate set.

### 4. Calculate distances locally

Use Haversine distance or a geometry library for candidate filtering.

Do not call a routing API to calculate every station-to-station distance.

### 5. Cache repeated routes

Optionally cache route responses using Django cache.

Cache key example:

```text
route:{start_lat}:{start_lon}:{finish_lat}:{finish_lon}
```

This is especially useful during Postman demos.

---

# 13. Testing Requirements

Write tests for:

### API

- Valid request
- Missing start
- Missing finish
- Invalid location
- Non-USA location
- No route

### Fuel calculations

Example:

```text
100 miles / 10 MPG = 10 gallons
```

If fuel costs $3/gallon:

```text
10 * 3 = $30
```

### Range

Ensure no selected driving segment exceeds:

```text
500 miles
```

### Optimization

Given a controlled set of stations, verify that the optimizer chooses the lower-cost feasible plan.

### Multiple stops

Create a synthetic route longer than 500 miles and verify multiple stations are returned.

---

# 15. Antigravity Master Prompt

Copy the following prompt into Antigravity:

---

## PROMPT START

You are a senior Python/Django backend engineer.

I need you to build a production-quality coding-assessment project for Spotter.

### Assessment

Build a Django API that accepts a start location and finish location, both within the USA, and returns:

1. A driving route between them.
2. Route geometry that can be rendered on a map.
3. Optimal cost-effective fuel stops along the route.
4. Multiple fuel stops when necessary.
5. Total fuel consumed and total fuel cost.

Vehicle assumptions:

- Maximum range: 500 miles
- Fuel efficiency: 10 miles per gallon
- Vehicle starts with a full tank.
- Fuel prices come from the supplied CSV.

### Input dataset

The CSV is:

`data/fuel-prices-for-be-assessment.csv`

Columns:

- OPIS Truckstop ID
- Truckstop Name
- Address
- City
- State
- Rack ID
- Retail Price

The file contains approximately 8,151 station rows.

Do NOT modify the original CSV.

First inspect the CSV and make the implementation match its actual schema.

---

## Technology Requirements

Use:

- Latest stable Django version available at implementation time.
- Django REST Framework.
- Python 3.12+ if compatible with the selected Django version.
- SQLite for simple local development.
- Clean service-oriented Django architecture.
- pytest / pytest-django.
- requests or httpx.
- python-dotenv or equivalent environment configuration.

Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

Do not build a frontend unless needed for a tiny demonstration. The assessment is primarily a backend/API task.

---

## Routing Provider

Use OSRM as the default routing provider unless there is a strong technical reason to choose another free provider.

The routing provider must be isolated in:

`fuel_optimizer/services/routing.py`

Create a class such as:

```python
class RoutingService:
    def geocode_location(...)
    def get_route(...)
```

Do not scatter external API calls throughout views.

The normal route API request should make only ONE routing request:

```text
origin -> destination
```

Do not call the routing API once per fuel station.

Return route geometry as GeoJSON if available.

---

## Geocoding Strategy

This is extremely important.

The CSV contains thousands of stations. Do NOT geocode thousands of stations during every API request.

Implement preprocessing:

```text
python manage.py import_fuel_prices ...
python manage.py geocode_fuel_stations
```

Use a free batch geocoding provider suitable for US addresses, preferably the US Census Geocoder for preprocessing.

The Census batch service supports up to 10,000 records per batch.

The geocoding command should:

1. Read stations from the database.
2. Create a batch input file.
3. Submit addresses to the geocoder.
4. Parse latitude/longitude.
5. Save coordinates to FuelStation.
6. Handle unmatched addresses gracefully.
7. Be safe to run again.
8. Never fail the entire import because a few stations cannot be geocoded.

Do not call the geocoder during the normal route optimization request unless absolutely necessary.

---

## Database

Create:

```python
FuelStation
```

with fields approximately:

```text
opis_id
name
address
city
state
rack_id
retail_price
latitude
longitude
created_at
updated_at
```

Add sensible indexes.

Do not require PostGIS unless you can justify it. Keep the project easy to run locally.

---

## Import Command

Create:

```text
python manage.py import_fuel_prices path/to/file.csv
```

Requirements:

- Validate required columns.
- Handle duplicate stations sensibly.
- Use bulk_create / bulk_update where appropriate.
- Convert Retail Price to Decimal.
- Do not store money as floating point.
- Provide useful console output.
- Be idempotent.

---

# Core Route Optimization

Implement:

```text
fuel_optimizer/services/fuel_optimizer.py
```

The optimizer receives:

- route geometry
- route distance
- candidate fuel stations
- vehicle max range
- MPG

The goal is to find a feasible, cost-effective fuel plan.

Important:

Do NOT simply select the cheapest stations in the whole CSV.

A station is useful only if it is:

1. Close enough to the route.
2. Ahead on the route.
3. Reachable with the current fuel/range constraints.
4. Useful for completing the trip.

---

## Candidate Filtering

Because thousands of stations exist, filter locally.

Suggested pipeline:

```text
All FuelStations
      ↓
Remove stations without coordinates
      ↓
Bounding-box filter around route
      ↓
Route corridor filter
      ↓
Project stations onto route
      ↓
Sort by distance along route
      ↓
Keep candidate stations
      ↓
Run fuel optimization
```

Use a configurable route corridor, e.g.:

```text
30 miles
```

Do not call an external routing service to calculate station-to-route distance.

Use local geographic calculations such as:

- Haversine distance
- Shapely if justified

Store:

```text
distance_from_route_start
```

for every candidate.

---

# Fuel Algorithm

Implement a clear and testable algorithm.

Vehicle:

```text
MAX_RANGE = 500 miles
MPG = 10
```

Start with a full tank:

```text
500 / 10 = 50 gallons
```

At a station, decide how much fuel to purchase based on:

1. Whether the destination is reachable.
2. Whether a cheaper station exists within the reachable range ahead.
3. The distance to that cheaper station.
4. The remaining fuel.

Use the classic minimum-cost gas-station greedy strategy where possible.

If the current station is cheaper than every reachable useful station, fill the tank.

Otherwise purchase enough to reach the next cheaper station.

Do not allow the calculated fuel quantity to exceed tank capacity.

For each selected station return:

```text
station
distance_from_route_start
distance_from_previous_stop
price_per_gallon
gallons_purchased
fuel_cost
```

---

# Important Cost Assumption

Document clearly how total cost is calculated.

Because the vehicle starts with a full tank, the initial fuel is assumed to be already available and its cost is not included in the trip's incremental fuel cost.

The API should calculate fuel consumed based on:

```text
distance / 10
```

The final result must explain this assumption.

If you choose a different interpretation, document it prominently and keep the implementation internally consistent.

---

# API

Create:

```text
POST /api/v1/route/fuel-plan/
```

Request:

```json
{
  "start": "New York, NY",
  "finish": "Chicago, IL"
}
```

Support structured locations if practical:

```json
{
  "start": {
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY"
  },
  "finish": {
    "city": "Chicago",
    "state": "IL"
  }
}
```

Response should be clean JSON containing:

```text
start
finish
route
vehicle
fuel_stops
fuel_summary
```

Route should include:

```text
distance_miles
duration_minutes
geometry
```

Fuel summary should include:

```text
total_distance_miles
total_gallons_consumed
total_fuel_cost
```

Use Decimal internally for money.

Round monetary output to two decimal places.

---

# Validation

Reject:

- Missing start
- Missing finish
- Empty strings
- Invalid locations
- Locations outside USA
- Impossible route
- Routes for which no feasible fuel plan exists

Return proper HTTP status codes.

Never expose stack traces or internal exceptions in production responses.

---

# Error Response

Use a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NO_FEASIBLE_FUEL_PLAN",
    "message": "No feasible fuel-stop plan exists within the 500 mile vehicle range."
  }
}
```

---

# Performance

The assessment explicitly says the API should respond quickly and use very few routing API calls.

Implement:

1. One route API request per uncached route.
2. Local station filtering.
3. Local distance calculations.
4. Database indexes.
5. Optional Django cache for repeated identical requests.
6. No per-station routing API calls.
7. No per-station geocoding during normal requests.

Add logging showing:

```text
routing API calls
candidate station count
optimization time
total request time
```

Do not log secrets.

---

- Duplicate records
- Decimal price parsing

### Calculator tests

Test:

```text
100 miles / 10 MPG = 10 gallons
```

Never make real external API calls from automated tests.

---

# Documentation

Create BOTH:

```text
README.md
SPOTTER_BACKEND_ASSESSMENT.md
```

README should be concise and developer-focused.

SPOTTER_BACKEND_ASSESSMENT.md should explain:

4. CSV format
5. Import process
6. Geocoding process
7. Routing provider
8. Fuel optimization algorithm
9. API contract

17. How to record the Loom demo

Include actual commands.

---

# Postman Collection

Create:

```text
postman/Spotter-Fuel-Optimizer.postman_collection.json
```

Include at least:

1. New York -> Chicago
2. Los Angeles -> Las Vegas
3. A long-distance route requiring multiple fuel stops
4. Invalid request

Use environment variables:

```text

```

---

# Code Quality

Follow:

- PEP 8
- Type hints where useful
- Small functions
- Clear docstrings
- Meaningful names
- No hardcoded secrets
- No unnecessary abstraction
- No duplicated business logic

Do not over-engineer.

This is a coding assessment, so readability and reasoning are more important than adding unnecessary infrastructure.

---

# Important Deliverable Requirement

After implementing the project:

1. Run the tests.
2. Run Django checks.
3. Run the server.
4. Test the endpoint.
5. Verify the response contains route geometry and fuel stops.
6. Verify total fuel cost.
7. Verify no selected leg exceeds 500 miles.
8. Verify the Postman collection works.
9. Verify README and SPOTTER_BACKEND_ASSESSMENT.md contain accurate commands.
10. Do not claim something works unless you actually tested it.

If an external service cannot be tested because it requires an unavailable key, isolate it cleanly and provide a mock/test implementation.

---

# Final Antigravity Output

When finished, show me:

```text
1. Final project structure
2. Setup commands
3. Environment variables
4. API endpoint
5. Sample Postman request
6. Sample response
7. Optimization explanation
8. Tests executed and their results
9. Any assumptions
10. Any remaining limitations
```

Do not stop after creating a skeleton.

Implement the actual working backend.

# 16. Suggested Loom Demo — Maximum 5 Minutes

Use this structure:

### 0:00–0:30 — Introduction

Say:

> "This is my implementation of the Spotter Backend Engineer assessment. It accepts a US start and finish location, calculates a driving route, finds cost-effective fuel stops within a 500-mile vehicle range, and calculates total fuel cost using 10 MPG."

### 0:30–1:30 — Code overview

Show:

```text
models.py
routing.py
fuel_optimizer.py
views.py
management commands
tests
```

Explain that the external route API is called once and station processing happens locally.

### 1:30–3:30 — Postman

Show:

```http
POST /api/v1/route/fuel-plan/
```

Example:

```json
{
  "start": "New York, NY",
  "finish": "Chicago, IL"
}
```

Show:

- Route distance
- Route geometry
- Fuel stations
- Fuel prices
- Gallons
- Total cost

Then demonstrate a longer route requiring multiple stops.

### 3:30–4:30 — Algorithm

Explain:

> "I first calculate the route, project nearby fuel stations onto the route, remove stations outside the route corridor, and then use the 500-mile range constraint to find a cost-effective sequence of stops."

### 4:30–5:00 — Performance

Explain:

> "The route provider is called once per uncached request. Fuel stations are pre-geocoded and stored locally, so the runtime request does not make thousands of geocoding calls."

# 18. Engineering Notes

The most important thing to demonstrate in the interview/assessment is not just that the endpoint works.

Demonstrate that you understood the constraints:

```text
8,151 fuel stations
        ↓
preprocessed/geocoded once
        ↓
local database
        ↓
ONE route API call
        ↓
route geometry
        ↓
local candidate filtering
        ↓
500-mile feasibility
        ↓
fuel-cost optimization
        ↓
JSON response
```

This architecture directly addresses the assessment's performance requirement while keeping the implementation understandable.
